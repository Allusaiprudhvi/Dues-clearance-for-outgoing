# Dues-clearance-for-outgoing

This was done using php and sql code is attached as well.
Currently, the process of getting the no dues certificate (which we get after clearing dues in all the departments) is lengthy and a time taking process. One should go to each and every department to check his/her dues. Then clear the dues and get an individual no dues certificate from each department. The main theme of this project is to reduce the effort of the outgoing students for getting the no dues certificate with minimal effort. This portal has three different users, an admin, a department and a student. The admin creates login credentials for all the existing students and departments.  Here ,in this portal the department can upload the dues form online and students can check for his/her dues using this portal. Through this portal the student gets a single no dues certificate ,once he clears all the dues from the respective departments. This portal will be handled by the academic office.
